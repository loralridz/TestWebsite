                    <h2>The Relationship between Project Management and "People at the Heart" (PATH)
                    </h2>
                    <p> To clarify, Clear and Pragmatic Project Management Solutions Limited focuses on Business Change and Business Transformation projects, programs, and initiatives, excluding construction and engineering projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>Did you know that a staggering 85% of such initiatives fail to achieve their objectives?
                    This significant failure rate, or rather a small 15% success rate, is perplexing, particularly considering it has persisted for decades. One of the common recurring factors contributing to the failure of business change projects/initiatives is people.</p>
                    <p>Shifting to a more positive perspective, in the most challenging business change initiatives, focusing on people rather than purely technical aspects can lead to an almost 100% success rate. This insight and strong belief inspired the creation of PATH-HIVE in 2019. The significance of the "hive" and its transformative potential in the space of project management will become apparent shortly.</p>
